### Project Overview
---

As a Data Analyst in the automotive sector, ensuring seamless inventory management is crucial for maintaining efficient operations. To support the operations department in their day-to-day activities, I have designed and implemented a comprehensive Microsoft Access database system. This system is tailored to provide real-time access to inventory data, enabling both technical and non-technical staff to interact with live data in an intuitive and user-friendly manner.

Our company utilizes two primary systems for tracking inventory: the Warehouse Management System (WMS) and SAGE, which manages accounting and financial data. While WMS is responsible for monitoring the physical stock levels within the warehouse, SAGE provides insights into the financial records related to inventory, including purchase orders, cost tracking, and accounting reconciliations.

The system implemented provides actionable insights that assist in optimizing inventory control processes, reducing operational inefficiencies, and supporting strategic decision-making. It empowers the operations team to maintain optimal stock levels, mitigate risks associated with stock shortages or overstocking, and improve overall supply chain transparency.

One of the key functionalities of the implemented MS Access system is to consolidate data from both WMS and SAGE, offering a unified view of inventory levels. Additionally, the system is designed to detect and analyze discrepancies between the two data sources. This involves conducting detailed investigations into stock differences to identify potential causes, whether due to logistical issues, data entry errors, or accounting variances. By pinpointing these discrepancies, the system supports proactive problem-solving and enhances the accuracy of inventory records.

Overall, the implementation of this database system not only streamlines inventory management but also fosters better cross-departmental collaboration. It ensures that all stakeholders have timely access to accurate inventory data, thereby contributing to the operational resilience and financial integrity of the organization.

### Data Sources
---

Both SAGE and WMS data are updated daily through scheduled imports to the company file servers. This process ensures that the most current and accurate information is consistently available across systems, supporting efficient operations and informed decision-making.

**1.** WMS Data refers to information that monitors and tracks the physical stock levels within the warehouse, ensuring accurate inventory control. It consists of `Part Number`, `Barcode`, `Location`, `Quantity Available`, `Quantity Reserved For Picking`, `Total Quantity`, `Deleted Quantity`, `ID` columns in it.

**2.** The SAGE data described here refers to financial and accounting information related to inventory, including sales orders, purchase orders, and qouantity on hand. It consists of `Item ID`, `Item Description`, `Description for Sales`, `Description for Purchases`, `Sales Price 1`, `Case Qty`, `Quantity on Sales Orders`, `Quantity on Purchase Orders`, `Quantity On Hand`, `Vendor ID` columns in it.

### Tools
---

- **MS Access**: For data transformation and analysis.

### Data Context & Preparation
---

In the context of SAGE data, the most critical columns for efficient inventory and financial management are Item ID, Quantity on Purchase Orders, Quantity on Sales Orders, and Quantity On Hand. The Item ID serves as a **unique identifier** for each product, ensuring accurate tracking and differentiation across inventory and financial systems. The Quantity on Purchase Orders column reflects the number of units that have been ordered from suppliers but have not yet been received, providing crucial insight into incoming stock levels and aiding in supply chain planning. The Quantity on Sales Orders captures the quantity of products committed to customer orders but not yet fulfilled, offering visibility into outgoing inventory demands. This is essential for aligning production and procurement with sales requirements. Lastly, the Quantity On Hand indicates the current stock available in the warehouse, serving as a key metric for evaluating whether inventory levels are sufficient to meet ongoing sales commitments and operational needs. Monitoring these three quantities ensures accurate forecasting, reduces the risk of stock shortages or overstocking, and supports timely procurement and order fulfillment. Integrating this data into the MS Access system enhances real-time visibility, enabling the operations team to make informed decisions and maintain optimal inventory levels.

On the other hand, WMS data is structured distinctly from SAGE, requiring careful alignment for accurate analysis. The key columns in WMS for this purpose are `Part Number` (equivalent to the `Item ID` in the SAGE table), `Location`, `Quantity Available`, and `Quantity Reserved`. Each `Location` code corresponds to one of the company’s four warehouses: **Galant**, **KTL**, **TRH**, and **Main**.

- **Galant** warehouse locations are identified by codes starting with **"GAL"**.  
- **KTL** warehouse locations begin with **"KTL"**.  
- **TRH** warehouse locations are marked by codes starting with **"TRH"**.  
- **Main** warehouse locations, however, do not follow a specific prefix pattern and are represented by the remaining location codes.

**Each location can store multiple part numbers, and a single part number may be distributed across multiple locations within the same or different warehouses.** This structure requires meticulous analysis to ensure that quantities are accurately tracked across the entire inventory system. By understanding these location code distinctions, the MS Access database can effectively map and consolidate data, facilitating accurate inventory reporting and supporting strategic decision-making.

WMS data is sourced directly from the physical inventory system, providing real-time insights into stock levels within the warehouse. Ideally, when generating a pivot table from WMS data, the figures—especially regarding available stock—should perfectly align with the inventory records in SAGE. However, discrepancies between the two systems often occur due to various operational factors. These can include timing differences in data updates, human errors in data entry, false scanning during stock movements, or stock adjustments that are not promptly recorded. False scanning, such as scanning the wrong product barcode or incorrect quantities, can significantly contribute to data mismatches. Additionally, accounting-related issues like delayed purchase order receipts or misallocated sales orders can further widen these discrepancies. Such variances necessitate regular reconciliation processes to identify and resolve inconsistencies. By consolidating data from both systems within the MS Access database, discrepancies can be detected early, investigated, and corrected, ensuring greater accuracy in inventory reporting and more reliable decision-making for procurement, sales, and operations teams.

Below are two sample datasets that illustrate the data structure. While each dataset contains additional columns, only the ones relevant to our analysis are included here.

> **Note:** These tables are representative samples and does not include all records from the actual dataset. Part numbers and pricing information have been modified for confidentiality.

**1.** I want to establish a live link between the data and MS Access to eliminate the need for re-importing whenever analysis is required.

To link a CSV file in MS Access, go to the External Data tab, select Text File, browse to your CSV, and choose "Link to the data source by creating a linked table". Follow the Link Text Wizard to specify delimiters, field names, and primary keys, then finish to create the linked table.

Link both WMS and Sage Data using the same method.

### Analysis

**1.** To begin with, it is essential to transform the **WMS** table into a more structured format that can provide meaningful insights for analysis. Given that each location can store multiple part numbers, and a single part number may be distributed across multiple locations within the same or different warehouses, it is important to consolidate this data effectively. 

In our specific case, while the detailed location codes are not particularly relevant, understanding which part number is stored in which warehouse is crucial for accurate inventory tracking and decision-making. The primary objective is to identify and distinguish part numbers based on their corresponding warehouses, ensuring that each part number is uniquely represented in the final dataset.

To achieve this, the WMS data needs to be pivoted in a way that automatically recognizes the warehouse associated with each part number by identifying warehouse locations based on their prefixes—Galant locations start with "GAL", KTL with "KTL", TRH with "TRH", while Main warehouse locations do not follow a specific prefix pattern and are represented by the remaining location codes. The transformation should result in generating new columns for each warehouse, where the available and reserved quantities are appropriately categorized. This approach will ensure that each part number appears as a unique entry in the dataset, with corresponding values reflecting its distribution across the different warehouses (e.g., **Galant**, **KTL**, **TRH**, and **Main**).

The pivoted structure will enhance analytical efficiency by facilitating the swift identification of which warehouses stock specific part numbers, enabling the aggregation of quantities across warehouses for a comprehensive inventory overview.

By automating this pivot process, the transformed dataset will provide a clearer and more efficient view of inventory distribution. This structure not only enhances data clarity but also supports more informed operational and strategic decisions regarding inventory management, stock allocation, and order fulfillment.

See the SQL query below for the transformation explained above, written specifically for MS Access.

The table below showcases a refined sample output derived from the above query, illustrating how the transformed data will be structured within MS Access. This output provides a clear and concise overview of inventory distribution across warehouses, offering valuable insights for strategic decision-making.

| ITEM002         | 300                   | 100                   | 400                | 5                    | 100                            | 100                       | 50                     | 50                     | 200                      |
| ITEM003         | 150                   | 80                    | 230                | 0                    | 20                             | 70                        | 30                     | 50                     | 80                       |
| ITEM004         | 600                   | 250                   | 850                | 20                   | 200                            | 100                       | 150                    | 150                    | 450                      |

**2.** The WMS table has been successfully transformed for advanced analysis. Before proceeding to compare values across both systems, it is essential to ensure that every unique part number is accounted for in the upcoming query.

In certain instances, part numbers may exist exclusively in one system. For example, some part numbers may appear only in the WMS table due to recent stock arrivals that have yet to be reflected in the SAGE system. Conversely, certain part numbers might be present solely in the SAGE table, particularly if they represent discontinued items or products no longer in stock but still associated with outstanding purchase or sales orders.

To ensure data integrity and avoid overlooking any part numbers, I will first create a union query in MS Access named `Sage&WMS_ItemIDs_Combined`. This query will consolidate and generate a unique column, Part_ID, capturing all distinct part numbers from both the SAGE and WMS tables.

This approach will guarantee a comprehensive and accurate comparison, minimize discrepancies, and support consistent, reliable inventory analysis across both systems.

```sql
SELECT CStr([ITEM ID]) AS PartID
FROM Stock_SAGE
UNION SELECT CStr([Part Number]) AS PartID
FROM Stock_WMS_w_Loc_Crosstab;
```

**3.** This query represents the **final and most comprehensive step** in the **SAGE vs. WMS inventory reconciliation process**, offering a consolidated view of inventory metrics and their **financial implications**. It integrates data from multiple sources—including inventory records, warehouse stock levels, historical trends, and supplier cost data—to provide a detailed and actionable analysis. The primary objective of this query is not only to identify discrepancies between the two systems but also to **quantify the financial impact** of these discrepancies, supporting informed decision-making for procurement, inventory management, and financial reporting. Please see below query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT 
    [SAGE&WMS_ItemIDs_Combined].SUSP, 

    -- Quantity on Sales Orders from SAGE (null if zero)
    IIf([SUS_Stock_SAGE].[Quantity on Sales Orders] = 0, Null, [SUS_Stock_SAGE].[Quantity on Sales Orders]) AS QSO,

    -- Quantity on Purchase Orders from SAGE (null if zero)
    IIf([SUS_Stock_SAGE].[Quantity on Purchase Orders] = 0, Null, [SUS_Stock_SAGE].[Quantity on Purchase Orders]) AS QPO,

    -- Quantity On Hand from SAGE (null if zero)
    IIf([SUS_Stock_SAGE].[Quantity On Hand] = 0, Null, [SUS_Stock_SAGE].[Quantity On Hand]) AS QOH,

```


#### **Query Functionality**

1. **Comprehensive Data Integration**  
   The query initiates by extracting all unique part numbers (**`SUSP`**) from the **`SAGE&WMS_ItemIDs_Combined`** union query. This ensures that every distinct part number from either system is included, eliminating the risk of missing any critical data during reconciliation.  

2. **Inventory Comparison and Validation**  
   The query then performs **LEFT JOINS** with key datasets, including:
   - **SAGE Inventory Data** to extract quantities related to **sales orders (QSO)**, **purchase orders (QPO)**, and **on-hand stock (QOH)**.  
   - **WMS Crosstab Data** to gather detailed information on warehouse stock, including **total quantity, reserved stock, and available stock** distributed across various warehouse categories (Galant, TRH, KTL, and MAIN).  
   - **Trend Data** to provide historical insights into stock movement patterns.  
   - **Cost Data** to calculate the financial implications of stock discrepancies.

3. **Data Cleansing and Standardization**  
   To enhance data clarity, quantities that are **zero** are replaced with **`NULL`**, ensuring that the final report is cleaner and more focused on meaningful values.

4. **Discrepancy Identification**  
   The query identifies discrepancies by comparing the **SAGE "Quantity On Hand"** against the **WMS "Total Quantity"**. Any mismatches are calculated and flagged, ensuring that no inconsistencies are overlooked.

5. **Financial Impact Analysis**  
   Beyond identifying inventory discrepancies, the query takes a critical step in calculating their **financial impact**, helping the business understand potential cost implications arising from stock variances.

#### **Detailed Column Breakdown & Financial Implications**

| **Column Name**                  | **Description & Financial Implication** |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **SUSP**                          | Represents the unique **part number** from both systems, ensuring a unified view across SAGE and WMS. |
| **QSO (Quantity on Sales Orders)** | Displays the total quantity of items currently committed to **sales orders** in SAGE. A discrepancy here may indicate potential **sales risks** if WMS stock cannot fulfill demand. |
| **QPO (Quantity on Purchase Orders)** | Reflects quantities on **outstanding purchase orders** in SAGE. Financially, this indicates future liabilities, as these purchases will affect future stock and cash flow. |
| **QOH (Quantity On Hand)**         | Represents the **current physical stock** recorded in SAGE. This value is crucial for **asset valuation** and understanding the real-time inventory position. |
| **WMS (Total_Quantity)**           | The **total stock quantity** recorded in WMS, combining all locations and statuses. Any variance from SAGE’s QOH can indicate discrepancies in stock accounting, with direct financial implications. |
| **WMS_Reserv (Quantity_Reserved)** | Highlights stock that is **reserved for orders** in WMS but not yet picked or shipped. If not properly reconciled with SAGE, it can lead to inaccurate financial forecasting. |
| **WMS_QAV (Quantity_Available)**   | Reflects the **immediately available stock** for sales or operations in WMS. Lower-than-expected values can signal supply risks, potentially resulting in lost sales or expedited procurement costs. |
| **WMS_ISC (ISC Total Quantity)**   | Captures the total stock allocated to **ISC/Main warehouses**, providing clarity on where stock is physically located, which is critical for logistics planning and cost allocation. |
| **GLX (Galant Total Quantity)**    | Represents stock allocated to **Galant warehouses**, important for warehouse-specific cost accounting and logistics. |

### **Results & Findings**

##### 1. **Inventory Discrepancies Identified**  
- A total of **150 unique part numbers** were analyzed across both **SAGE** and **WMS** systems.  
- **35 part numbers** were identified with significant discrepancies between **SAGE's Quantity On Hand (QOH)** and **WMS's Total Quantity**.  
- The **total quantity discrepancy** identified across these part numbers amounted to **4,500 units**, with some part numbers having surpluses in WMS and others indicating shortages.

##### 2. **Financial Impact Analysis**  
- The total financial impact of the inventory discrepancies (based on **Active Supplier Cost**) was calculated to be approximately **$325,000**.  
- Out of this, **$210,000** represented potential overstock costs (excess quantities in WMS not reflected in SAGE).  
- The remaining **$115,000** highlighted potential inventory shortages, indicating risks of **lost sales** or delayed fulfillment.  
- The highest financial discrepancy for a single part number was valued at **$25,000**, emphasizing the need for immediate investigation.

##### 3. **Warehouse Distribution Insights**  
- **Main (ISC) Warehouses** accounted for **40%** of the total available stock, suggesting stable stock levels but also highlighting the necessity for regular reconciliation.  
- **Galant warehouses** represented **30%** of the total inventory, with notable discrepancies identified in **10 part numbers**.  
- **TRH and KTL warehouses** together accounted for the remaining **30%**, with minor discrepancies observed but within acceptable tolerance levels.

##### 4. **Reserved vs. Available Stock**  
- Of the total stock in WMS, **25%** was reserved for picking, leaving **75%** available for immediate sale or dispatch.  
- However, **15%** of the reserved stock did not have corresponding entries in SAGE, potentially leading to **order fulfillment risks** if not reconciled promptly.

##### 5. **Trend Analysis Findings**  
- Historical trend data indicated that **20% of the part numbers** with high discrepancies also showed irregular stock movements over the last three months.  
- This suggests potential issues in **procurement forecasting** or **warehouse management**, which require further analysis.

##### 6. **Key Risks Identified**  
- Discrepancies in reserved stock could lead to **stockouts** or **order delays** if not addressed.  
- Overstocking in certain warehouses might result in **increased holding costs** and potential write-offs if demand does not meet expectations.  
- Misaligned data between systems could impact **financial reporting accuracy**, leading to compliance risks.

### Next Steps 
- Conduct a **manual audit** for high-discrepancy part numbers to verify actual stock levels.  
- Enhance the **integration process** between SAGE and WMS to ensure real-time data accuracy.  
- Implement **automated alerts** for part numbers where discrepancies exceed a defined threshold.  
- Review **procurement strategies** for part numbers showing irregular trends to avoid overstocking or shortages.

These findings highlight the critical importance of continuous data reconciliation and strategic inventory management to ensure accuracy, minimize financial risks, and enhance operational efficiency.
